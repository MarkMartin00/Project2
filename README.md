             DM game assistance
             
Bonus-Action is a friendly interactive web-page assisting DM's in their adventure for new players who aren't sure of the rules and need assistance with dice rolls and character sheet references. Get rid of time explaining numbers and what to add during every event. 

             Online friendly environment 

With our online friendly character sheet we can bring the inconvenience of relocation and packing up hefty game dice, sheets, and writing utensils. Easily log into your created characters from anywhere and use them, update them, and create new ones on the go. Great for traveling or online events as well.

             Create your Character â€“ Bring your adventure to life!

Let's start by creating a character:

    1.) Choose a name 
    2.) Choose your class. Will you be a tough Barbarian or a magical cleric to assist your group?
    3.) Many Game Master's start at different levels. What level is this character?
    4.) Choose a background.
    5.) Choose your race, many have different abilities and additions to your class.
    6.) What's your moral compass? Choose your alignment.
    7.) Roll ability scores for your adventure and put them into the boxes. Ask your DM for assistance with 
            which numbers should go where.
    8.) Save Changes to save your character  and save the character if everything looks great! Congratulations 
            you can now play.
